I am originally from orlando florida home of one of Disneys feature animation studios. At an early age my father who was an animator brought home photoshop and since then I have been on a 
path of creativity ever since. Ive done everything from photography, graphic design, and not my new endevor to become a full stack web developer. 

With any projects I work on, there is a little piece of myself.
